Slang to Formal Text Expander (AutoHotkey v2)

This script utilizes AutoHotkey (AHK) to automatically and instantly expand common internet slang, text messaging shortcuts, and professional acronyms into their formal, full-length phrases.

The goal is to help maintain a professional and consistent writing style across all applications (email, documents, chat, etc.) by correcting casual shorthand as soon as it's typed.

üöÄ Setup and Requirements

This script is written for AutoHotkey v2 (AHK v2).

Download AutoHotkey v2: If you don't already have it, download and install the latest v2 release from the official AutoHotkey website.

Save the Script: Save the contents of the slang_expander.ahk file (from the Canvas editor) to your computer.

Run the Script: Double-click the saved .ahk file. The script will start running in the background, indicated by a new icon in your system tray (usually marked with an 'H').

The script is now active and will perform instant text replacements in any program where you type.

üìù Key Examples in Action

The script uses a simple syntax (:*:shortcut::Expanded Phrase) which replaces the shortcut instantly as you type it.

üîß Customization and Editing

You can easily modify this script to add your own shortcuts or change existing expansions.

The core format is:

:*:shortcut::Expansion Text


Tips for Editing:

Instant Replacement: The :*: prefix ensures that the text replacement happens immediately, without requiring you to hit space, enter, or punctuation afterward.

Case Sensitivity: By default, AHK hotstrings are not case sensitive. If you type BTW, it will still expand to by the way.

Adding New Terms: Simply add a new line under the appropriate section header (or create a new section) and use the format shown above.

Reloading: After saving any changes to the .ahk file, you must reload the script. To do this, right-click the AHK icon in your system tray and select "Reload".
